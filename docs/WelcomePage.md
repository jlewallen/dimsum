# Welcome Page

This is your brand new help page that you can edit by using `edit
help`.

First, it's important to know that the main way you interact with this
world is by typing things in. Simple English-like commands from a
grammar that grows with your world. Commands like:

```
look
hold box
drop
```

You may notice that we've styled that text differently, that's because
those are examples of things you can type in yourself. Give it a try!

One thing that may stand out in the list above is that the `hold` verb
takes more words, in this case a noun to help locate the thing you'd
like to hold. Many verbs and other verb-like commands work this
way. Actually, ensuring as much as possible is initiated via a command
like this is a key part of the DesignPhilosophy. Another is that as
much as possible should be extendable and curated for inclusion in the
greater library of glorious, behavior and curiousity inspiring
plugins.

Feel free to explore the world and this help system. Some other topics

For a good place to start learning how things work behind the scenes
you can try reading DesignPhilosophy.

Enjoy!
